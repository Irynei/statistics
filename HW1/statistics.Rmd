```{r}
ceodata <- read.csv('ceo.csv')
ceodata$X <- NULL
salary <- ceodata$salary
head(ceodata)
```

### 1.a

```{r}
mean(salary)
```
Mean(2027.517) - average salary.

```{r}
mean.default(salary, trim=0.1)
```
Trimmed mean(1710.092) - mean of salaries without lowest 10% and highest 10% of values.  
Used to eliminate the impact of vary large or very small salaries on the mean.

```{r}
median(salary)
```
Median(1600) - central salary. Half of salaries are smaller than median and half are larger.


```{r}
quantile(salary, c(0.25, 0.75))
```
Lower quartile(1084.0) - 25% of salaries are smaller than lower quartile (consequently 75% are larger)  
Upper quartile(2347.5) - 75% of salaries are smaller than upper quartile (consequently 25% are larger)


```{r}
quantile(salary, c(0.1,0.9))
```
Lower quartile(750.0) - 10% of salaries are smaller than lower quartile (consequently 90% are larger)  
Upper quartile(3384.4) - 90% of salaries are smaller than upper quartile (consequently 10% are larger)



### 1.b

```{r}
Fn <- ecdf(salary)
plot(Fn)
```
Empirical cumulative distribution function of salaries

```{r}
quantile(salary, c(0.2))
quantile(salary, c(0.8))
Fn(1000)
1 - Fn(5000)
```
*
  $F^{-1}(0.2)=976.2$ - 20% of CEOs have at most $976.2 salary.  
  $F^{-1}(0.8)=2613$ - 80% of CEOs have at most $2613 salary.

*
  $F(1000)=0.223$ - 22.3% of CEOs have at most $1000 salary.  
  $1 - F(5000)=0.053$ - 5.3% of CEOs have at least $5000 salary.


### 1.c

```{r}
hist(salary)
```
```{r}
hist(salary, breaks = 30)
```
```{r}
hist(salary, breaks = 3)
```

```{r}
boxplot(salary)
```

```{r}
hist(log(salary))
mean(log(salary))
median(log(salary))
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
qplot(x=Var1, y=Var2, data=melt(cor(ceodata)), fill=value, geom="tile") + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red")
```
